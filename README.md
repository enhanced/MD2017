# MD2017 Repo

I'll put things in here that I create or find useful for the MD2017.

Presently there is only one file in here, a simple python script that creates formatted csv for use in importing into the MD2017.  Unfortunately because of lazy developers I had to create this.  

Usage is simple...

1. Clone it
2. Run it and redirect the output 

Example:
`./gencontacts.py >contacts.csv`
